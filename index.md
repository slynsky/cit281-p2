## Project Purpose and Components
The purpose of this second project was mainly to get students thinking about editing their code, so the main task was refactoring given code.

## What I Learned
This project was really good for getting me to think about the most efficiant, clean, organized, and modern way to write my code. It also gave me the tools to work on revamping older code, or to work with a team who might have different styles.
